Note to Timmy:
CLEAN YOUR GOD-DANM ROOM! I'm tired of you and,
your bomb-zone room. I swear to god, if I get 
home and there's ONE peice of garbage on your
floor, I will tear your skin off your back.
And don't think I won't, you know how things
are now. Oh, and feed the lizard. We got you
that thing only because you promised to take
care of it, and you know what the deal was.
Feed the lizard or else we'll see if lizard
really does taste like chicken.
